  description: |
    This template gives a service api implementation based on a 'laplacian-arch.service-api' model.
    The implementation employs following architechture stack:
      - Alpine based docker image
      - OpenJDK8
      - SpringBoot 2
      - Java-Graphql

    By default, a sub-project is generated for each 'feature' in the model and each sub-project can be deployed
    as an independent service.
